In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms:Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character isthus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them fromtime to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. Wehave reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We haveappealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of ourcommon kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt ourconnections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and ofconsanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation,and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends. We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress,Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do,in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish anddeclare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States;that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection', 'between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free\\n\\nand Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances,\\nestablish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right\\n\\ndo.
